## British Airways Review Dashboard (Tableau Project) üìä
This project involved designing and developing an interactive dashboard in Tableau to analyse customer reviews of British Airways between March 2016 and October 2023. The dashboard allows users to explore various aspects of the airline's performance, including overall ratings and specific service metrics such as cabin staff service, food, entertainment, ground service, seat comfort, and value for money. Users can filter data by traveller type, seat type, continent, and aircraft model, making the analysis highly customizable and insightful.

The dashboard features a time-series chart to show how average ratings have changed over time, a map visual to display country-wise, and a comparative analysis of different aircraft based on review scores and volume. The findings revealed key insights, such as the Boeing 747-400 receiving the highest average rating and areas like food and entertainment receiving lower scores. This project demonstrates data visualisation, storytelling through data, and the ability to translate raw data into actionable insights.

## End-to-End ETL and Machine Learning Pipeline on Google Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è
An automated ETL pipeline designed to ingest, process, and analyze data from CSV files and a CRM system using Google Cloud services. The workflow begins with data ingestion into Google Cloud Storage (GCS), where a Google Cloud Function automatically detects new files and loads them into BigQuery. Data transformation occurs within BigQuery, structuring raw data into optimized fact and dimension tables for analytics and reporting.

For business intelligence, tools like Looker and Looker Studio are integrated to create dashboards and enhance reporting efficiency through pre-aggregated views in BigQuery. These tools allow business users to interact with data intuitively, facilitating real-time insights and decision-making. Additionally, BigQuery ML is used for in-database machine learning, with Python notebooks supporting more advanced model training and evaluation. Insights from machine learning models are seamlessly visualized within Looker Studio, ensuring a complete pipeline from raw data ingestion to actionable intelligence.

## Human Preference Prediction for Chatbot Responses(LLM) - Kaggle üèÜ
A machine learning project focused on predicting user preferences in chatbot-generated responses using NLP techniques and deep learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, response evaluation, and model inference. Text similarity metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and cosine similarity were used to assess chatbot performance, while GPT-2 was leveraged for tokenization and response analysis. The project optimizes chatbot alignment with human preferences across multiple languages, ensuring a structured and efficient pipeline.

## Data Visualisation Portfolio using Power BI üìä
This project is a comprehensive Power BI portfolio where I applied advanced data modeling, transformation, and visualization techniques to create dynamic, interactive dashboards. By leveraging DAX for complex calculations and Power Query for data wrangling, I transformed raw data into meaningful insights. The dashboards feature multiple reports with intuitive drill-throughs, slicers, and custom visuals, providing users with a detailed, yet user-friendly, experience. This project demonstrates my ability to build sophisticated, data-driven solutions that enable stakeholders to explore trends, analyze key metrics, and make informed decisions.
