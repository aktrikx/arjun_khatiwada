## Data Visualisation Portfolio using Power BI 📊
This project is a comprehensive Power BI portfolio where I applied advanced data modeling, transformation, and visualization techniques to create dynamic, interactive dashboards. By leveraging DAX for complex calculations and Power Query for data wrangling, I transformed raw data into meaningful insights. The dashboards feature multiple reports with intuitive drill-throughs, slicers, and custom visuals, providing users with a detailed, yet user-friendly, experience. This project demonstrates my ability to build sophisticated, data-driven solutions that enable stakeholders to explore trends, analyze key metrics, and make informed decisions.
