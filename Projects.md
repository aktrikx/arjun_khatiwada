## NHS Bed Utilisation Dashboard üá¨üáßüõèÔ∏è

The NHS England Beds Report 2025 dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of hospital bed availability and occupancy across various categories, including General & Acute, Mental Illness, Maternity, and Learning Disabilities. It presents data trends across years and distinguishes bed usage by shift (Day vs. Night), offering insights into healthcare capacity utilisation and operational dynamics within NHS England hospitals.

The dashboard reveals that General & Acute beds make up the largest share of total capacity and consistently show high occupancy levels, reflecting ongoing pressure in this area. Mental Illness beds, while representing a smaller proportion of total beds, exhibit particularly high occupancy rates over 90% in recent years, indicating a persistent strain on mental health services. Learning Disabilities and Maternity beds make up a smaller fraction of overall capacity and also show considerable usage levels.

Shift analysis reveals that more than 90% of occupied beds are recorded during the night shift, raising questions about operational efficiency and resource allocation during daytime hours. This disparity could point to issues in admission patterns, patient flow, or data logging practices, suggesting the need for further operational review.

From a temporal perspective, the year-over-year trends suggest relative stability in bed numbers, with a noticeable dip around 2020 likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While bed numbers have recovered since then, occupancy has remained high, emphasising the need for continuous monitoring and capacity planning.

Key challenges identified include high occupancy in Mental Illness and General & Acute categories, underutilization during daytime shifts, and limited capacity for specialised services such as Learning Disabilities. Potential solutions involve optimising shift-based scheduling, expanding mental health infrastructure, and ensuring more balanced distribution of resources. By leveraging these insights, healthcare administrators can better address service gaps and improve patient care outcomes.

## British Airways Review Dashboard (Tableau Project) üìä
This project involved designing and developing an interactive dashboard in Tableau to analyse customer reviews of British Airways between March 2016 and October 2023. The dashboard allows users to explore various aspects of the airline's performance, including overall ratings and specific service metrics such as cabin staff service, food, entertainment, ground service, seat comfort, and value for money. Users can filter data by traveller type, seat type, continent, and aircraft model, making the analysis highly customizable and insightful.

The dashboard features a time-series chart to show how average ratings have changed over time, a map visual to display country-wise, and a comparative analysis of different aircraft based on review scores and volume. The findings revealed key insights, such as the Boeing 747-400 receiving the highest average rating and areas like food and entertainment receiving lower scores. This project demonstrates data visualisation, storytelling through data, and the ability to translate raw data into actionable insights.

## PNG Contact Table Extractor üßæ

This project focuses on automating the extraction of structured contact information from PNG images that contain contact tables. These tables typically include details such as contact name, job title, phone number, extension, email, and role type. The core objective was to convert these often messy and inconsistently formatted image-based tables into a clean, organised Excel file, with one contact per row and all fields correctly aligned.

The problem arose when using traditional OCR tools like Adobe Acrobat, which exported the text but produced unreliable results‚Äîdata fields were frequently misaligned, with names, titles, and emails appearing on the wrong lines or merged together. Additionally, the variation in field labelling and inconsistent formats for phone numbers and extensions made manual cleanup tedious and inefficient, especially when dealing with multiple image files.

<img width="1433" alt="pngtoexcel_result" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18afd652-afb6-45eb-82d3-7ea12105b546" />

To solve this, I developed a Python script that uses Tesseract OCR to extract raw text from each image and applies a combination of regular expressions and logical rules to identify and clean up the relevant data. The script intelligently parses through the OCR output to extract structured information such as names, titles, phone numbers, email addresses, and role types. It uses contextual cues and keyword matching to fix misplacements and inconsistencies. After extracting and organising the data, the script compiles everything into a structured Excel spreadsheet using the pandas and openpyxl libraries.

The project leverages Python along with libraries such as Pillow for image processing, pytesseract for OCR, pandas for data manipulation, and regular expressions for pattern matching. The result is an efficient, automated pipeline that transforms folders of contact table images into a single, well-formatted Excel file, saving hours of manual data entry and cleanup.

This project demonstrates practical applications of OCR, text processing, and automation, and highlights the power of Python in solving real-world data extraction problems.
