## End to End Machine Learning Project on AWS  


This project is an end-to-end machine learning application designed to predict customer churn for e-commerce platforms, utilizing Python and Flask. The workflow includes acquiring and preprocessing a dataset from Kaggle, developing and evaluating machine learning models, and creating a Flask web application for user interaction. The application is deployed and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, with WinSCP used for secure file transfers and PuTTY for SSH access. This project showcases the complete process from model development to deployment, emphasizing how to implement and host a machine learning application in a cloud environment.

## Book Price Prediction



The so-called paradoxes of an author, to which a reader takes exception, often exist not in the author's book at all, but rather in the reader's head. - Friedrich Nietzsche Books are open doors to the unimagined worlds which is unique to every person. It is more than just a hobby for many. There are many among us who prefer to spend more time with books than anything else. Here we explore a big database of books. Books of different genres, from thousands of authors. In this challenge, participants are required to use the dataset to build a Machine Learning model to predict the price of books based on a given set of features. Size of training set: 6237 records Size of test  set: 1560 records FEATURES: Title: The title of the book Author: The author(s) of the book. Edition: The edition of the book eg (Paperback,– Import, 26 Apr 2018) Reviews: The customer reviews about the book Ratings: The customer ratings of the book Synopsis: The synopsis of the book Genre: The genre the book belongs to BookCategory: The department the book is usually available at. Price: The price of the book (Target variable)

Evaluation: 1 - np.sqrt(np.square(np.log10(y_pred +1) - np.log10(y_true +1)).mean())

## Amazon Job Vacancy Alert



  
This project is a Python script that automatically checks for job vacancies on the Amazon Warehouse jobs website. If a job matching your specified location (e.g., "Remote location") is found, the script sends an alert email to the user. It also handles pop-ups, such as cookie consent and location permission prompts. The script is set up to run every 10 minutes, ensuring continuous monitoring for new job opportunities.

## Coronavirus Case Study



This project is a global epidemiological analysis focused on COVID-19 data. The primary objective is to analyze and summarize the COVID-19 case and death statistics across 213 countries from December 2019 to December 2020. The project aimed to identify key trends, such as peak periods for cases and deaths, and to examine the distribution of the pandemic's impact across different countries and continents. By assessing both country-specific and continent-specific statistics, the project sought to provide a comprehensive understanding of the severity and progression of COVID-19 on a global scale.

## Food Order Prediction


Built a machine learning model to predict the number of food orders for a restaurant chain using time series data.
The client, a multi-city meal delivery company, operates numerous fulfillment centers responsible for dispatching meal orders to  customers. To enhance operational efficiency, the client seeks a demand forecasting solution to help these centers plan for upcoming weeks, This forecasting will enable centers to optimize the stock of raw materials, which are replenished weekly and are highly perishable, making precise inventory planning critical. Additionally, accurate demand predictions will support effective staffing at each center, ensuring they are adequately prepared to meet customer needs. The objective is to predict demand over the next 10 weeks for each center-meal combination in the test set, utilizing historical demand data, product-specific features (such as meal category, sub-category, price, and discount), and fulfillment center information, including center location and city attributes.

## Nepali News Scraping



This project involves web scraping news articles from the Nepal News website (https://www.nepalnews.com/) to gather information on recent news headlines. The objective was to extract and compile news headlines along with their corresponding URLs into a structured format. Using a web scraping tool or library, such as BeautifulSoup in Python, the project captures the news headlines and their links from the website. The scraped data is organized into a dataframe, which includes columns for the news headlines and their URLs. Finally, this dataframe is saved to a CSV or Excel file on the desktop for easy access and further analysis. The project effectively demonstrates the process of data extraction from a website, data organization, and saving the results in a user-friendly format.

## Demand Forecasting (SARIMA Model) 




This demand forecasting project aimed to optimize workforce planning during major sales campaigns, where accurate demand predictions were essential for smooth operations. We implemented a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, which reduced average forecasting errors by 12% compared to the company’s historical model. This improvement enabled more precise workforce scheduling to handle surges in order volume during peak periods. Additionally, we introduced manual adjustments for post-holiday delivery backlogs, allowing for flexibility in handling predictable demand spikes. This combination of advanced modeling and practical adjustments ensured optimal staffing, timely deliveries, and enhanced operational efficiency, ultimately aligning resources with real demand patterns and reducing costs during critical high-demand periods.
